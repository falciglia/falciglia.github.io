***Deep Learning for Neuroengineering***

---

ðŸ“š My Research
======

Hi, I'm a PhD student at the Biorobotics Institute of the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies in Pisa. I work in Professor Alberto Mazzoni's computational neuroengineering lab. My main interests are information processing in the nervous system, neural signal decoding using deep learning techniques, neuro-robotics and biorobotics applications.

I spent a year (Aug 2022-July 2023) as a trainee researcher at EMBL Rome in the Asari group in Visual Systems Neuroscience, and nine months (Jan-Sept 2024) as a pre-doctoral research fellow at the Biorobotics Institute, working with Professor Mazzoni.

I got my BSc in Electronic Engineering with honours from the University of Catania in 2021 and my MSc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics with honours from the Sapienza University of Rome in 2023, which I did while I was at the Superior School of Advanced Studies (SSAS) Sapienza.
